\textit{Abstract}

Automated testing frameworks are widely used for assuring quality of modern software in secure software development lifecycle. Sometimes it is needed to assure quality of specific software and, hence specific approach should be applied. In this work an approach and implementation details of automated testing framework suitable for acceptance testing of static source code analysis tools is presented. The presented framework is used for continuous testing of static source code analyzers for C, C++ and Python programs.
